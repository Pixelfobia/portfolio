# Portfolio Sergio Utrera

## This project is part of a Frontend Developer Bootcamp exercise for Edx. It is a first draft to build a professional portfolio.The main problems that I have found have been to assimilate the different options when adjusting the structure in a responsive way, also the positioning of the elements within the layers, and finally, the importance of the constant use of Git to have orderly and available the different changes that occur in the creation process.
